📌 CodSoft Internship Projects
This repository contains three Python projects developed during my CodSoft internship:

✅ To-Do List
A command-line based task manager that allows users to add, view, update, complete, and delete tasks. Each task is stored with a status to track completion.

🧮 Calculator
A simple calculator built in Python that supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using user input.

🔐 Password Generator
A Python script that generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined length. It includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters for better security.
